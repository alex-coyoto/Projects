# Projects
This repository contains my most interesting pet-projects
### University Projects
[This folder](https://github.com/alex-coyoto/Projects/tree/main/University%20Projects) contains the most interesting projects for 4 years of my studies at the university. My speciality is computer science, so I've written lots of interesting projects in various programming languages during this time. Feel free to explore it!
### Veles Trading
[My own project](https://github.com/alex-coyoto/Projects/tree/main/Veles%20Trading), which was originally supposed to be called "**JavaScript for Everything!**". The project consists of 3 applications at the moment: [Browser Extension](https://github.com/alex-coyoto/Projects/tree/main/Veles%20Trading/vt-browser-extension), [Telegram Bot](https://github.com/alex-coyoto/Projects/tree/main/Veles%20Trading/vt-bot) and [Mobile Application](https://github.com/alex-coyoto/Projects/tree/main/Veles%20Trading/vt-mobile). I used JavaScript to write each of them and they're all connected. Each of them is interesting in its own way so take a look at them!
