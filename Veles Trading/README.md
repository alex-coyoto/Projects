# Veles Trading
The project consists of 3 applications that perform similar functionality, but are written for different systems. Their main goal is to monitor the current value of [BTC/USDT cryptocurrencies](https://waves.exchange/trading/spot/BTC_USDT). Each of the application receives the necessary data in real time through API to subsequently display to the user if successful. Telegram Bot and Mobile Application allow users to "exchange" the currency at the current rate meanwhile Browser Extension is intended for monitoring the ratio of currencies only. All applications are written in Java Script.
